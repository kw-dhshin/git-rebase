# Git Rebase Practice

This repository is for practicing **git rebase** and conflict resolution.

---

## Instructions

1. Check out the `feature` branch.  
2. Rebase the branch onto `main`.  
3. A conflict will occur in `sort.js`.  
4. Open the file, resolve the conflict manually, and continue.  
5. After finishing, check the commit history with `git log`.
